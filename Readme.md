The current itteration of the project is not yet finished but a fully working beta is hoped to be completed before Decemeber 2020.

Sensors currently supported so far: DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, the BMP280 temperature, humidity and air pressure sensor and Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
